Welcome to BrightSide Dental Studio’s quick guide to keeping your smile healthy in Sampletown. These dentist-approved tips help prevent cavities, reduce sensitivity, and keep your gums happy between visits.

## Daily habits that make the biggest difference
- **Brush twice daily for two minutes** using a soft-bristle brush and fluoride toothpaste.
- **Floss once a day**—even a quick nightly floss lowers cavity risk between teeth.
- **Rinse after sugary or acidic foods** to protect enamel, then brush 30 minutes later.
- **Sip water often** to reduce dry mouth and wash away food particles.

## How to prevent dental emergencies
- Wear a nightguard if you grind or clench.
- Use a sports mouthguard for contact sports.
- Fix small chips or cracks before they worsen.
- Stay up to date on cleanings and exams to catch issues early.

## Diet tips for healthier teeth
- Choose **crunchy fruits and veggies** (apples, carrots) to stimulate saliva.
- Limit **sticky snacks** and frequent sipping of sugary drinks.
- Add **dairy or fortified alternatives** for calcium and vitamin D support.
- Consider **xylitol gum** after meals to reduce bacteria.

## FAQs
**How often should I see the dentist?**
Most patients do best with twice-yearly cleanings, but if you have gum concerns or are in aligners, we may recommend more frequent visits.

**Do I need fluoride?**
Fluoride strengthens enamel and reduces decay risk. We’ll tailor the strength (prescription or OTC) to your needs.

**Is mouthwash necessary?**
It can help with fresh breath and gum support, but brushing and flossing matter most. We’ll suggest a formula if you have sensitivity or dry mouth.
