## Are you a candidate?
You may be a great fit for implants if you:
- Have one or more missing or failing teeth
- Want a stable alternative to partials or dentures
- Have healthy gums and are free of active infection
- Can commit to good home care and routine checkups

2. **Personalized plan:** Options, timelines, and transparent estimates—no surprises.
3. **Placement day:** Comfort-first approach with gentle anesthesia; guided surgery for accuracy.
4. **Healing & check-ins:** We monitor healing and attach a custom abutment and crown once you’re ready.
5. **Smile reveal & maintenance:** Enjoy a confident smile; we’ll share easy home-care tips.

## Costs, insurance, and financing
